# Health Related Tweets Exploratory Data Analysis, Topic Modeling, and Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

This repository contains code and data for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), topic modeling, and sentiment analysis on health-related tweets using Naive Bayes classification. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a step-by-step guide to understand the data, extract topics, and classify sentiment.

## Introduction
With the increasing popularity of social media platforms, such as Twitter, the analysis of health-related tweets has become essential for understanding public opinions, trends, and sentiments towards various health topics. This repository provides a comprehensive approach to analyze health-related tweets, including EDA, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis consists of health-relExploratory Data Analysis
The EDA section of the notebook provides an overview of the dataset, including data cleaning, visualization of tweet frequencies, analysis of popular hashtags, and identification of most frequent words.

## Topic Modeling
In the topic modeling section, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to extract topics from the tweets. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess the text data, create a document-term matrix, train the LDA model, and visualize the topics using word clouds.

## Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis section focuses on classifying the sentiment of the tweets using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The notebook illustrates how to preprocess the text data, split it into training and testing sets, train the Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions can help make this project better for everyone.ated tweets collected from various sources. The dataset is provided as a CSV file named Secondary_Dataset.csv and is included in the repository.
